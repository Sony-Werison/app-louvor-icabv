    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to reflect the application's core features: Schedule View, Music Library, Member Directory, and Playlist Management. The structure prioritizes authorization independence and predictable security rules. User-owned data is structured under `/users/{userId}`. Collaborative data, such as schedules, uses membership maps for access control. The `members` map on the Schedule document denormalizes access control, enabling atomic operations and avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. This design also ensures that listing schedules is secure, as the rules do not act as filters (QAPs). Segregation is achieved by placing user-specific data (like playlists) under their respective user IDs, ensuring that different collections have distinct security postures. Songs are stored in a top-level collection to simplify access and management, given that they are not directly user-owned."
